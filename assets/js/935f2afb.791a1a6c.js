The rows in the database tables represent the infrastructure in your cloud account. Our dashboard provisions a PostgreSQL database for you and configures it to manage an AWS account and region. The database is automatically backfilled with all your existing cloud resources. Which tables are loaded into an IaSQL database is configured based on what IaSQL modules are installed in a db. Every IaSQL module represents a cloud service like awsec2 or awselb. Once the desired modules are installed with the install IaSQL PostgreSQL function, run INSERT or UPDATE queries on the database by using the PG connection string displayed when you first set up in the dashboard with your preferred PostgreSQL client. Finally, run the iasql_apply PostgreSQL function to provision infrastructure in your cloud account based on the IaSQL db.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"how-to/aws":{"id":"how-to/aws","title":"Manage an AWS Account","description":"IaSQL requires AWS credentials to manage the resources within the account.

AdministratorAccess provides full access to deploy and manage all types of resources. ReadOnlyAccess access provides access to inspect all of the different kinds of existing resources but does not modify them or create new ones.
